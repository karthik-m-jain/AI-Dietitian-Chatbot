- - Hello Rajesh, How are you ?
  - Hi, I am fine.
- - What do you usually have in lunch ?
  - Pizza. This is just a snack.
- - Pizza with a lot of cheeze? Rajesh, whenever I see you , you often eat either junk food or having soft drinks!
  - Who cares? I am a healthy person and never fall sick.
- - That is not the point. The food you eat has high calories and salt. It is bad for you.
  - Oh I see! then what do you recommend I eat?
- - Have good, fresh and homemade healthy food like idlis, salads, chapatis, with vegetables. They are healthier but junk food give you weakness and other illness.
  - Well, Thank You for your suggestions. I shall try to change my food habits.
